## Blackdot pkgsrc repository
###########################################
Replacement for the old omnios.blackdot.be repository.

The pkgsrc repository provided by joyent provides most 
packages that were available in the older omnios repository.

This repository is a suppliment to the joyent repository,
packages are prefixed with pbd. It provides the few missing bits.

Everything is provided as-is. Some packages are taken from pkgsrc-wip.

Check out http://pkg.blackdot.be/ for how to use this repository.
