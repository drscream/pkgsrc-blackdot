sjorge: make sure it's pkglint clean then nag me to commit it, though there are a couple of issues with it - you can't assume $PREFIX/etc is used, needs to honour PKG_SYSCONFDIR, remove etc entries from PLIST and use CONF_FILES to handle them, also replace hardcoded /var with VARBASE

I tried the LDFLAGS.SunOS+=-lsocket  with no success though, but that might have been because it was chocking on the other flags that are linux only

jperkin
depends if it honours LDFLAGS or not
